			Hello, my name is Juan Manuel and I'm 29 yo. I'm currently located in Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· and working as a Senior iOS/watchOS developer at 
			<a

				target="_blank"
			>Runna</a>, a running coaching app.
		</p>
		<p>
			My professional journey in the development world began in 2018, during the last year of my Software Engineering studies.
			I started with cross-platform technologies such as Xamarin and React Native, but then transitioned to native iOS development using Swift, which I fell in love with due to the language and its ecosystem.
			Since then, I've been focused on increasing and applying my knowledge to develop for Apple platforms.
			I have real-world experience with Objective-C, Swift, UIKit, SwiftUI, several mobile architectural patterns, Combine, RxSwift, Swift Package Manager, CocoaPods, and more.

		<p>
			I value working for high-impact products because it allows me to see firsthand how my day-to-day work translates into meeting people's needs and changing lives.
			I'm particularly interested in topics such as programming, UX/UI, finances & economy, startups, literature, philosophy, science, health & fitness, and more.
			Everyday, I try to apply my technical knowledge to full-time and freelance jobs, as well as open-source contributions that are aligned with these interests.
		</p>
		<p>
			In my free time I usually work on side projects, read books, run, go to the gym, hang out with people, or plan trips to expand my knowledge of the world around me.
		</p>
		<p>
			Feel free to send me a DM.
