## Short story about myself

When I was a teenager I wanted to be a writer. I remember I read a ton of
literature. I started a blog and I even participated as a co-author on an
anthology of stories published in the city I grew up. But then I started
studying software engineering. In parallel, I wrote some articles on Medium in
order to try to merge technology and literature/books but, as days went by, my
time was getting more and more scarce. I got graduated, I started my journey as
a developer, I felt in love with my professional life and I never looked back.

That being said, I think there is a deep relationship between writing words and
writing code. I mean, in both cases you have a person in front of a computer
_creating something_. In the first case, the result will be a story, a novel, a
poem. In the second case, an app, a web, a script, a machine learning model. The
difference is not a problem: _you’re creating something_. You’re using your
neural connections to go from 0 to 1. From nothing to something. You’re like a
god. And that’s kinda cool.

## Plan

My idea here is to do both things. I’m trying to have a personal space in which
I can write words and code, and be able to share it with the rest of the world.
I’m not interested on writing fiction anymore (those melancholy days as a
teenage writer are a part of the past) but I think I can use that love of
writing to document and share things I'm learning in my life as a software
developer.

To be more clear, right now my life revolves around the following themes:

- Swift/iOS development:
  - Learning a bunch of cool things on my job at Venmo/PayPal.
  - Participation in some side projects (iOS apps).
- Startups (fintech, crypto/web3, health, fitness, environment, UX/UI,
  development, science, productivity, AI).
- Investments and financial freedom.
- Reading.
- Random things (gym, my new cats 🐱, etc).

I plan to write, probably in a mounthly basis, what I have learned about these
topics.

## Why I didn’t start blogging about tech before

Some examples of my thoughts:

- _“Nothing I can produce will be original, because there are a lot of really
  good tech blogs that are covering the 100% of the available content related to
  the topic”._
- _“I’m not an expert at anything and because of that, if I write a single word
  about some topic, I’ll be a fraud”._
- _“What will X think about this shit?”_

## Benefits of blogging

After thinking a lot about my hurtful thoughts, and after reading

I came out with some good arguments:

- _Show the “behind the scenes” of some work_: it’s interesting for some people
  to know about the process of doing some work instead of just see the final
  result. I’d love to know about the learning process from someone with more
  experience than me in some creative thing (for example, creating a side
  project from scratch). That’s why documenting what I learned on a weekly basis
  is quite interesting to me (and hopefully for someone out there).
- _Beginner mindset_: sometimes, _a beginner is better at teaching to other
  beginners than someone who is an expert_ (because when you become so pro at
  something, you forget what it’s like to be a beginner). I’m a newbie at
  investments, but I’m constantly learning and documenting. These beginner
  documents can be useful to other beginners.
- _Serendipity_: if I share my interests in public I can, in some way, _attract_
  people with same likes. And this is cool. I’d love to know more about things
  that interest me, and also to build community around these topics.
- _Good for mental health_: some studies said journalling is good for mental
  health. The process to transform thoughts into words allows you to streamline
  and shape them.
- _Butterfly effect_: from
  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect):

  > … _a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can
  > result in large differences in a later state._

Maaaaaaaaaaaaybe I can create a tornado somewhere in the world with the movement
of my fingers on the keyboard. Let’s see.

## Disclaimer: why I’m writing in English?

Reasons:

- I’ll talk mostly about development and the vast majority of developers I know
  are native English speakers or non-native speakers that can read, write and
  speak in English.
- It’s the
  [most used language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_used_on_the_Internet)
  on the Internet. I can reach more audience.
- I wanna improve my written English (that’s why if you see an error in my
  texts, please feel free to reach me and provide me feedback! Even beter,
  [PR's](https://github.com/gentilijuanmanuel/gentilijuanmanuel.github.io/pulls)
  are more than welcome! Again, _beginner mindset_). Also, if you’re not an
  English expert, you can use this newsletter to practice reading 😉

## Thanks

If you got here, it means you’re genuinely interested on what I’m saying. Thank
you a ton, you don’t know how much this means to me. I’ll do my best to keep you
entertained!
