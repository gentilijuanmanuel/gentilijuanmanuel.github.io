After a year of biting my nails, of battling the FOMO fueled by social media
that wouldn’t stop showing videos of the brothers making gestures on stage, or
of the thousands and thousands of people jumping, singing, crying in stadiums
all over the world, the day finally came. The day of seeing, live, the band of
my adolescence. Oasis at River Plate, 2025 tour.

I read on X a fan who wrote, after the show, that the passage of time is unfair
and relentless: when milestones happen —events that turn people’s lives inside
out, that shift certain foundations, certain structures— it isn’t right for
everything to keep moving forward the next day as if nothing had happened. We
demand a pause. Anything that has nothing to do with the event itself must stop,
abruptly, to give way to a period of reflection, of processing. Because
milestones leave an echo. Immediately after witnessing them, you don’t
understand anything. You’re left with a bitter aftertaste you can’t explain and
don’t know where it comes from. Time settles it, kneads it, ages it, turns it
into something intelligible, expressible.

I came back from Buenos Aires in airplane mode. After the concert, a sadness
took shape —a void, a contained urge to cry in the backyard of my mind that I
couldn’t understand. I got home and immediately the vines of everyday
responsibilities began to populate the garden of my brain. The invincible
tick-tock of the clock: work with its pre-concert loose ends that were now
urgent, obligations with looming deadlines for a longed-for but stressful move,
pets, expenses, the general maintenance of life. The constant holding on, to
keep everything from going to hell. But that back corner of the garden was
asking something of me that the vines couldn’t fully silence: sit down and
write, sit down and write. Try to process it, try to put into words whatever
happened during those two hours of fully argentinized British rock and roll.

The following Wednesday I managed to carve out a few minutes to vomit words into
my personal journal. Something came out; something got cut short. Drafts.
Electric reflections, shapeless. And the vine constantly trying to knock down
the door, creeping forward with lianas and leaves through the millimeters of
space between frame and opening.

Today, twenty days after the event, close to the end of a year that went by like
a snap of the fingers, I find myself on a plane headed to the Gallaghers’
homeland for work reasons, rethinking what happened that night. I’m moving
through time zones over the Atlantic; it feels like the relationship with time
is different here: it stops, it becomes a parenthesis —exactly what we were
demanding. No one asks anything of you; the phone stops being a rattle. Time has
a scent. You can taste the Chilean wine the flight attendants serve.

Being busy is a status symbol nowadays, they say —more than vacations, more than
leisure time. Playing at being an adult, at having a thousand things to do. But
that game can easily get out of hand. The seriousness of the game, especially
the compulsive kind. Ten years ago, I listened to _Stay Young_ and _Live
Forever_ until my eardrums begged for mercy. The message was clear: an ode to
youth, to the immortality of new souls, untainted by the pain of the adult
world. The images of all the rock and roll icons flashing through Oasis’s
visuals at Maine Road ’96 —most of them died at 27; there is a club that
represents them. I had a “club” with two lifelong friends, the oldest group in
my WhatsApp: _Artaud_. We named it that because one afternoon we emptied our
adolescent wallets to buy, between the three of us, the _Pescado Rabioso_'s
disc. We always joked about the 27 Club —whether we’d make it there or not. When
we finally turned 27, we celebrated. We endured life.

Today, eternal youth is romanticized; the fear of aging has become pathological:
longevity hacks, collagen, the medicalization of consumption. Did _Stay Young_,
_Fade Away_, and _Live Forever_ contribute to that trend? I don’t know. I think
the crux of the matter wasn’t being young forever and living to be 150 —quite
the opposite. It was about living so intensely that the fire of your existence
leaves an indelible mark on the memories of others. As Hunter S. Thompson said:

> _Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving
> safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways, in
> a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up and worn out, and loudly proclaim: Wow!
> What a ride!_

It’s not only a status symbol, but also a sign of having some kind of direction
in life. Of following a path with a convinced chest. Of being on the road,
everything under control. Of distinguishing oneself from lost souls. Look, I
know what I’m doing, where I’m going. I know my north. My fifteen or
sixteen-year-old self, listening to _Listen Up_ or _The Masterplan_ on the
semicircular balcony of my bedroom in my parents’ house, didn’t have that luck:
the world presented itself as an accumulation of small chaos that, when stitched
together, generated an even greater, superlative chaos. Everything was
confusion: navigating the insecurities of first relationships, trying to
understand what surrounds you, fighting ghosts, anxiety, hunger for glory,
steering dreams. One could say that fifteen years later I have a more stable
reality in pragmatic terms: my professional career is going well, I’m in a
company and an industry where impact is plausible, there’s demand and there’s
also reward. Plus, the stability of a long-term relationship gives you the
chance to project into the long term, to venture and carry out decidedly adult
ideas. But every time everything seems to run smoothly, without friction needing
lubrication (_“life is automatic”_), I remember that adolescent with existential
problems —undoubtedly more wounded and vulnerable to external stimuli than this
2.0 version— taking refuge from his identity crisis in an idolization of Liam’s
strong personality, and I recognize a deeper truth in his condition: no matter
how much the world distracts you with its fancy stuff and endlessly reinvented
carrots, no matter how much experience and traveled paths dispel some fears,
confusion, the certainty of being lost, and inevitable mortality are always
running, relentless, in the background. And there is a certain joy, a certain
freedom, in accepting that unbreakable fate. As Dylan says in _Like a Rolling
Stone_:

> _When you have nothing, you have nothing to lose_

(though he also said, in _Tryin’ to Get to Heaven_:

> _When you think you’ve lost everything, you find out that you can always lose
> a little more_

—but that’s a topic for another post). Everything hangs by a thread, and in some
respects that small adolescent in the throes of adolescence had it clearer,
closer to the surface, than many adults running on autopilot.

Time passed, and the unpredictability of the world ended up playing in our
favor. At the time, it wasn’t crazy to assign a higher probability to a meteor
wiping us out like the dinosaurs than to the possibility of an Oasis reunion. I
never put many chips on it —kind of pessimist by default. So that listening
experience was nostalgic from the start, orphaned. The separated brothers were a
bond with my sister, a shared obsession. River 2009 was experienced through a
pixelated YouTube filter; Noel at Rosario’s Metropolitano and Liam at the
Movistar Arena were emotional echoes but insufficient—more map than territory.
Just as life can surprise you for the worse, it can also do so in the opposite
direction. Who would have imagined it? Not even in the wettest dreams of that
pubescent kid smoking on the balcony, staring at the stars while injecting
himself with artificial ego through _Supersonic_ or _Cigarettes & Alcohol_, or
melancholy through the fateful _MTV Unplugged_. I remember having a Post-it
stuck to my bedroom wall with a handwritten Melville quote:

> Be true to the dreams of thy youth.

I don’t know if I followed it to the letter in every respect, but this was
definitely one of them.

Oasis: an isolated place in the desert where there is water and vegetation
grows. It’s night in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean; the lights are off, most
passengers are asleep. The only glow is my laptop screen; the only sound, the
keys being pressed. This plane is an oasis over the ocean. Just as the traveler
who stumbles upon the mysterious lake must hydrate and continue on his way, in a
few hours I’ll have to leave this plane and reenter, once again, the twisted
pipes of everyday life. Another X user posted that he loved the _"gordos
Oasis"_: on Monday they’d go back to being accountants, freelancers, lawyers, to
having boring lives —but for one weekend they were all the same, they were all
supersonic. Supersonic was the kickoff at River that called for the need for a
room of one’s own, for the retrospective island.

The water of the oasis is warm; stepping in with the first foot isn’t hard.

The world can wait.
